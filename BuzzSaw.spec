  lib/BuzzSaw/Report/Kernel.pm.in, lib/BuzzSaw/Report/Sleep.pm.in:
  Reworked how the default value for the report module tags list is
  handled. Now it defaults to containing the lower-cased version of
  the name attribute. This avoids the possibility of the module
  being given ALL events for the period to be processed when no
  specific tag list has been set

  BuzzSaw::UserClassifier to be an attribute, this means we can
  lazily build it when required rather than at module load time.
  Also added documentation for the module

* Thu Mar 14 2013 15:16 squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK
- lib/BuzzSaw/Filter/Cosign.pm.in, lib/BuzzSaw/Filter/SSH.pm.in,
  lib/BuzzSaw/Filter/Sleep.pm.in: updated docs

* Thu Mar 14 2013 15:15 squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK
- lib/BuzzSaw/Filter.pm.in: Updated docs

* Thu Mar 14 2013 15:13 squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK
- lib/BuzzSaw/Importer.pm.in: Updated docs

* Thu Mar 14 2013 15:11 squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK
- lib/BuzzSaw/Importer.pm.in: Altered the voting process slightly.
  Now anything returning a true value will have the tags retained
  but the entry (and tags) will only be stored if one or more
  filter returns a positive value. This change helps
  post-processing where we need tags to be retained but do not want
  to alter the current state of the votes

  unimport moose once it is not required

* Thu Mar 14 2013 14:08 squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK
- lib/BuzzSaw/Report.pm.in: Made it much simpler to add new
  directories to the template search path. Made it possible to
  alter the default sort order

* Thu Mar 14 2013 14:07 squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK
- lib/BuzzSaw/Filter.pm.in: Added a basic name attribute

* Thu Mar 14 2013 14:07 squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK
- lib/BuzzSaw/Importer.pm.in: Tweaked slightly so that when calling
  a filter the current number of votes and the results of the
  previous filters are passed in. This makes it much easier to do
  post-processing (such as user classification)

* Thu Mar 14 2013 14:06 squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK
- lib/BuzzSaw/Filter/UserClassifier.pm.in,
  lib/BuzzSaw/UserClassifier.pm.in: Added new module for
  classifying type of user name (root, nonperson, real, others)
